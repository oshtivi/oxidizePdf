/// Sanitize extracted text by removing or replacing control characters.
///
/// This function addresses Issue #116 where extracted text contains NUL bytes (`\0`)
/// and ETX characters (`\u{3}`) where spaces should appear.
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// - Replaces `\0\u{3}` sequences with a single space (common word separator pattern)
/// - Replaces standalone `\0` (NUL) with space
/// - Removes other ASCII control characters (0x01-0x1F) except:
///   - `\t` (0x09) - Tab
///   - `\n` (0x0A) - Line feed
/// - Normalizes `\r` and `\r\n` to `\n`
/// - Collapses multiple consecutive spaces into a single space
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use oxidize_pdf::text::extraction::sanitize_extracted_text;
///
/// // Issue #116 pattern: NUL+ETX as word separator
/// let dirty = "a\0\u{3}sergeant\0\u{3}and";

///
/// // Standalone NUL becomes space
/// let with_nul = "word\0another";
/// assert_eq!(sanitize_extracted_text(with_nul), "word another");

/// // Clean text passes through unchanged
/// let clean = "Normal text";
